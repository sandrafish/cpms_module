This is an effort at getting data from a series of pages such as this one: http://cpms.dfa.state.nm.us/doShowAppropriations.aspx?pid=10-1100

The pages have been downloaded to local files. Trying to retrieve five years of info.

There are odd breaks in the HTML, so trying to parse it in four steps/files.

Comments in files indicate issues.

But probably going about this entirely the wrong way.
